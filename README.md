## Built With
- typescript
- React 
- ant design
- create-react-app
- express

### Web app
 - cd in to consumers folder -> web

 ### App start 
 - root folder

 ### Init DB  - create db and run migration

### Notes
- Frontend can be optimized further ( make ui components more re-usable)
- I didn't get enough time due to office work
because of that could not work on the mobile app (also I do not have much experience with react native, so it will take more tme),
